# MNIST-calssification

Various classifiers are tested to classify the MNIST dataset as follows:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- SVM
- Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network

Note that no crossvalidation on the parameters of the classifers has been performed. One might do that by changing the paramaters in utils.py
